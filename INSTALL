Requirements:
    Qt4 (You may need to apply a patch, qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.6-for_gcc_5_and_6.patch)
    cmake
    qtermwidget (https://github.com/qterminal/qtermwidget)

Build:
    A shadow build (out of source) is strongly recommended
    http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_FAQ#Out-of-source_build_trees

    1) mkdir -p build && cd build
    2) cmake path/to/source
    3) make
    4) optional: make install

    Read cmake docs to fine tune the build process (CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, etc...)
